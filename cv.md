### **About me:**

Started JS Stage 0 online course in RS School in June 2022 and i hope i will get familiar with it in the nearest future. I've never done something like this what makes it a greater challenge for me. I've changed a lot of jobs but it was never even close to programming.
Currently i am working on a local radio station as sound engineer and sometimes broadcaster.

### **Skills:**

### **Languages:**
English: upper intermediate
